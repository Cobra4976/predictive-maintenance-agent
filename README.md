# Predictive Maintenance AI Agent

An industrial predictive maintenance dashboard that analyzes real-time sensor data to predict equipment failure. Built with React, Vite, and TailwindCSS.

## Features

- **Real-time Analysis**: Instant feedback on sensor readings (Temperature, Vibration, Pressure, Operating Hours).
- **Visual Indicators**: Color-coded urgency levels (Low/Medium/High).
- **Actionable Insights**: Specific maintenance recommendations and estimated time to failure.
- **Simulated AI**: Robust rule-based engine that mimics industrial predictive maintenance logic.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript + Vite
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS
- **Icons**: Lucide React
